        <p>
          I'm all about diving into data adventures and uncovering the stories they hold. 
          I geek out over crunching numbers, playing with algorithms, and finding the 'aha' moments hidden in datasets.
          <br /><br />

          My expertise covers a spectrum - from wrangling data to building cool predictive models and 
          creating visualizations that tell a story. All under the glorious light of Python, SQL, Statistics 
          and an understanding of machine learning models.
          Whether it's predicting trends, detecting funky outliers, 
          or optimizing processes, I love the thrill of cracking the data code.
          <br /><br />
          
          What drives my excitement is turning raw data into actionable insights that make a real impact. 
          I'm on a constant quest to unravel data mysteries and turn them into game-changing strategies. 
          Let's decode data together and make something awesome out of it!
           <br /><br />

          If you're seeking someone proficient in data science methodologies and programming languages such as Python & SQL, feel
          free send me an email. I'm currently
          <strong> open to work starting May 2024.</strong>
